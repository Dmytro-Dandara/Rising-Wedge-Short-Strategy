Strategy Concept
This script identifies short wedge patterns on the chart and executes short trades when the price breaks below the wedge formation. A short wedge in this context means the price is consolidating upwards (forming higher lows and higher highs), but within converging trendlines â€” a pattern often followed by a bearish breakout.

- A breakout downward is often interpreted as a short (sell) signal.
